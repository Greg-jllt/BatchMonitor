# Topic 01: To the Market

The country of PATIBULAIRE wishes to increase its weapon potential and wants to acquire at least:

- 100,000 rifles,
- 200,000 grenade,
- 100 tanks,
- 400 machine gun and as many bazooka.

To do this, they turn to a weapons merchant named MALANDRIN. This merchant collects the material, used or not, from all the war fields.

These merchants offer 3 types of Batch_list (M$ = million dollars).

|                  | Batch 1 | Batch 2 | Batch 3 |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Rifles           | 500     | 300     | 800     |
| Grenades         | 1000    | 2000    | 1500    |
| tanks            | 10      | 20      | 15      |
| machine gun      | 100     | 80      | 15      |
| Bazookas         | 80      | 120     | 200     |
| Costs of Batches | 10M$    | 12M$    | 15M$    |

1 - Write the problem as a linear program and solve it. We will assume, perhaps wrongly, that the batches are fractionable. We can propose a graphical representation of the constraints.

2 - On his side, a unitary fruit manufacturer DETAILIN wants to take over the market. He is therefore looking to determine the unit prices of the 5 types of fruit. The goal is for each of the 3 batches to cost at most like MALANDRIN's batches. But he is also looking to maximize his profit. Write the associated linear problem and solve it. We will compare the matrix forms of the two problems. We will also compare their respective solutions. This linear problem is called the dual form of the previous linear problem.

3 - MALANDRIN varies the price of his first batch. Study the impact of this variation for the two problems.
